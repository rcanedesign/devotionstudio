Perfection Smooth Out<br>
How does it work?<br>
Perfection's proprietary Nano-Amino Complex miraculously suspends the internal textural memory of the hair to safely transform it to a new, soft and sensual look and feel.<br>
How long does it last?<br>
By following the Perfection SmoothOut service with regular use of the Perfection Smoothing sulfate and salt-free Shampoo and Conditioner, the hair will retain its new sleek and smooth memory state for 8-12 weeks. It will then gradually return to its pre-service state with no line of demarcation.<br>
Who is the Perfection SmoothOut Service for?<br>
The Perfection SmoothOut Solution has a low pH formula and contains no harsh chemicals, which make it safe to use on all clients. Unlike the trouble-filled Thio and Brazilian-type straighteners of recent past, Perfection's advanced formula poses no health risk and actually improves the integrity of the hair.<br>
Can the Perfection SmoothOut service be applied over hair that is color-treated, highlighted and/or bleached?<br>
The Perfection SmoothOut service can be successfully applied to color-treated, highlighted and/or bleached hair. In fact, Perfection is so gentle it allows for same-day color and shampoo.<br>
